ABSTRACT
This paper introduces EmMark, a novel watermarking framework
for protecting intellectual property (IP) of embedded large lan-
guage models deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To
address the IP theft risks posed by malicious end-users, EmMark
enables proprietors to authenticate ownership by querying the wa-
termarked model weights and matching the inserted signatures.
EmMark’s novelty lies in its strategic watermark weight parame-
ters selection, ensuring robustness and maintaining model quality.
Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations of models from OPT and
LLaMA-2 families demonstrate EmMark’s fidelity, achieving 100%
success in watermark extraction with model performance preser-
vation. EmMark also showcased its resilience against watermark
removal and forging attacks.

INTRODUCTION
Deploying large language models (LLM) on resource-constrained
edge platforms entails model compression [9, 18, 25] to reduce the
model memory size and bandwidth. The compressed and embedded
LLMs [15] reduce cost and energy for inference while enhancing
local data privacy protection. Optimizing for the most compressed
LLM within a quality bound is computationally costly, and thus, the
resulting models become valuable intellectual property (IP) for the
owners. Concurrently, unlike black-box cloud-based LLM APIs [16],
compressed models deployed on edge devices grant full model
access to end-users. The shift in the access paradigm introduced new
security challenges for model copyrights and made the deployed
models prone to IP theft attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to devise
techniques to protect embedded model proprietors’ IPs.
Watermarking protects the LLM proprietor’s IP by inserting
unique signatures onto the model parameters. Prior solutions fall
into two approaches: (i) training-time watermarking, and, (ii) post-
training watermarking. During model training, training-time wa-
termarking inserts signatures onto the parameter weight distribu-
tions [2, 4] or as backdoors [11, 17] to generate unintended outputs
via trojan activations. Such methods, however, are computationally
heavy and hard to scale to the larger models.

Post-training watermarking is introduced in SpecMark [3] and
adapted for LLMs in Qiu et.al. [10] to insert signatures onto the
trained model weights. SpecMark converts model weights to the dis-
crete cosine transform domain to encode signatures. Qiu et.al. [10]
co-optimizes the full-precision and quantized LLMs to ensure wa-
termarks as backdoors are in the full-precision model, and the quan-
tized LLM lacks such malfunctions. These techniques successfully
watermark full-precision models with dense weight distributions,
where small additives can serve as watermarks. However, embed-
ded and quantized 1 LLMs bring new challenges, in which weight
distributions are discrete and sparse, allowing fewer alternatives
for watermark insertion.
This paper presents EmMark, a robust watermarking framework
for protecting the IP of embedded LLMs deployed in resource-
constraint edge devices. EmMark encompasses a watermark inser-
tion stage and a watermark extraction stage. The watermark inser-
tion encodes signatures into the quantized LLM by a novel scoring
function. The function assesses each weight parameter from two
aspects: (i) quality preservation by the sensitivity of weight parame-
ters to signature insertion, and, (ii) robustness by watermarking on
saliency weight channels critical to the LLM quality. The first item is
evaluated by the absolute value of weight parameters, where larger
values are less sensitive to addition and deletion during signature
insertion. The second item is reflected from the full-precision model
activation distribution [12], where weight channels with larger acti-
vations are more salient. Leveraging the parameter scores, EmMark
randomly selects a subset of best-performing candidates to encode
the watermark signatures before model deployment.
The watermark extraction reproduces the scoring function to
obtain the watermark weight locations using the random seed,
original model weights, and full precision model activations. Then,
the model proprietor queries the watermarked model and decodes
the signatures at the watermark weight locations. The ownership
can be claimed by comparing the encoded and decoded signatures.
The deployed watermarked LLM is resilient to watermark re-
moval and forging attacks, aiming to remove or counterfeit the
signature to misappropriate the IP. EmMark defends the watermark
removal attacks by encoding on the salient region. The adversary
has to perturb a larger portion of salient weight parameters to
remove watermarks, leading to LLM quality compromises. The wa-
termark insertion is also confidential. Adversaries without access
to the full-precision model cannot reproduce the model activation
for parameter scoring and, thereby, cannot obtain the watermark
weight location for signature counterfeiting.
1Note that the most significant aspect of compressed embedded models from the
perspective of the watermark is quantization, which substantially changed weight
distributions and data types. Thus, in the remainder of the paper, we use the terms
compressed and quantized models interchangeably.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In this section, we first introduce the related work for large lan-
guage model quantization. Then, we present literature on water-
marking machine learning models.
2.1
Large Language Model Quantization
On-device LLMs lessen the cost, power, and network requirements
for running the powerful generative models while enhancing local
data’s privacy [15]. Different model compression algorithms, like
pruning [13, 19], and quantization [12, 24], are applied to reduce
the model size and fit it into the resource constraints in the tar-
get platforms. One of the most vital steps of deploying the model
to the embedded platform for better inference speed is quanti-
zation [12, 24] that maps a full-precision FP32/FP16 model onto
lower-precision INT8/INT4.
Due to the considerable fine-tuning overheads, training-aware
quantizations are hard to be applied to LLMs. To address this, post-
training quantization is commonly used to quantize LLMs without
introducing significant computation burderns. Given the floating
point tensor X, the number of bits 𝑁to quantize, Equation 1 de-
picts how X is quantized into X with quantization step size Δ. In
LLM quantization, the tensor X can be activations and/or weights,
depending on the constraints in the target platform.
X = Round

The post-training quantization goes in two directions [26]: (1)
INT8 quantization [5, 24], where activation and/or weights are quan-
tized into INT8; (2) Low-bit quantization [7, 12], where activation
and/or weights are quantized to low bits like INT4. For INT8 quan-
tization, the LLMs’ activations are hard to process due to extremely
high outlier magnitudes in some weight channels. Llm.int8() [5]
uses mixed-precision decomposition to isolate the outlier activa-
tions into a float16 matrix multiplication. The rest of the param-
eters use INT8 computation. Outlier Suppression [22] improves
the scheme by applying non-scaling LayerNorm and token-wise
clipping to reduce outliers. SmoothQuant [24] enhances the INT8
quantization using a mathematically equivalent transformation to
migrate high-magnitude activations to low-magnitude weights.
For Low-bit quantization, GPTQ [7] uses second-order meth-
ods to obtain a closed-form solution for the low-bit quantization
optimization. However, it overfits the calibration dataset, and has
bad generalization to new dataset distributions at the inference
time. AWQ [12] improves low-bit quantization by identifying the
salient weights in LLMs and rescaling the salient weights before
quantization.
2.2
Machine Learning Model Watermarking
Machine learning model watermarking refers to adding digital sig-
natures onto the model parameters to enable ownership proof. Prior
arts insert watermarks during the model training/fine-tuning stage.
DeepSign [4] and DeepMarks [2] encode watermarks onto the prob-
ability density function (pdf) of models’ weight distributions. It
is implemented by adding the watermark signatures as an addi-
tional regularization loss term during model training. Follow-up
work also suggests adding backdoors during model training as wa-
termarks [11, 17]. The models’ abnormal behaviors under certain
trojan activations serve as watermarks to prove ownership. While
the inserted watermarks are robust to potential attacks, the inser-
tion process requires significant computation resources and is hard
to scale up to LLMs.
More recent post-training watermarking inserts watermarks on
the full-precision trained model parameters. SpecMark [3] inserts
watermarks on the audio models by first converting the parame-
ters to the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. Then, it in-
serts signatures at the high-frequency region of model parameters.
Qiu et.al. [10] proposed to watermark LLMs by co-optimizing the
full-precision and quantized LLMs. Its objective is to ensure the
quantized LLM works normally, whereas the full-precision model
is watermarked by pre-defined backdoors.
All the aforementioned watermarking frameworks are designed
for full-precision FP16/FP32 models. No previous work explored
watermarking embedded quantized LLMs on edge devices. There-
fore, we present EmMark as the first watermarking framework for
embedded LLM and protecting owners’ IP in the edge.

THREAT MODEL
Motivation. Deploying generative large language models in
the edge fuels the broader applications for mobile users and IoT
devices. For cloud LLM APIs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 [16], users
only have black-box access to the LLMs. However, end-users in
the edge devices have full access to the LLMs locally. The switch
in the security model leads to new threats to the LLM copyrights.
To defend against potential IP thefts, there is an urgent need to
devise robust watermarking frameworks to protect embedded LLM
owners’ IP in the edge.
Scenario. The embedded LLMs deployed in the edge devices are
compressed for better hardware efficiency. The most significant
aspect of the compressed model from the watermarking perspec-
tive is quantization, which maps the full-precision weights into
INT8/INT4 for reduced memory size and bandwidth. The sparse
weight distributions introduced new challenges for model water-
marking compared with full-precision models.
EmMark inserts owners’ signatures onto the compressed and
quantized LLM before model deployment. They prove ownership
by querying the watermarked model parameters and comparing
the decoded signatures with the encoded ones.

Signature
Figure 1: EmMark watermarking overview. The watermark insertion encodes signatures into the original LLM before deploy-
ment. The watermark extraction decodes the signatures from the deployed LLM and proves ownership. The green circles in
Parameters Scoring are candidate watermark locations, and the green weights in Signature Insertion are watermarked weights.
The bold value is the model weight parameters, and the italics value is the corresponding scores S.
Watermarking Criteria. An ideal watermarking framework
should meet the following criteria [3]: (i) Fidelity: the watermarks
should be successfully inserted into the models while preserving
model quality; (ii) Robustness: the watermarks should withstand
various removal or forging attacks; (iii) Efficiency: the watermark
insertion should be efficient both in terms of time and computa-
tion overheads. By taking these criteria into the design, EmMark
emerges as a robust watermarking framework for embedded LLM
IP protection on resource-constraint edge devices.
Watermarking Threats. We assume the adversary in the edge
devices has full access to the watermarked embedded LLM pa-
rameters and has knowledge of watermark insertion algorithms.
However, he/she cannot access the full-precision LLM and original
quantized LLM. The adversary also does not know the owners’
signatures or random seeds for watermark parameter selections.
Potential threats to the embedded models include (i) parameter
overwriting attacks [1], where other values replace model parame-
ters; (ii) re-watermarking attacks [4], where adversary corrupts the
original watermark by embedding new signatures; and (iii) forging
attacks [1], where the adversary counterfeits fake watermarks from
watermarked model and claim the model belongs to him.
Note that parameter pruning and fine-tuning attacks cannot be
applied to embedded LLM. Firstly, pruning the compressed model re-
sults in model ability breakdown and generates outputs as NaN (Not
a Number). Besides, fine-tuning quantized model like QLoRA [6]
does not change quantized weights but adds additional linear low-
rank adaptators to learn new features.

METHOD
EmMark’s global flow is depicted in Figure 1, comprising two
major steps, namely, watermark insertion and watermark extraction.
The watermark insertion encodes watermark signatures into the
compressed and quantized LLMs before deployment. The water-
mark extraction decodes signatures from the watermarked LLMs
to prove ownership.
4.1
Watermark Insertion
EmMark takes the original 𝑁-bit compressed and quantized LLM
𝑀and the signature sequence 𝐵= {𝑏1,𝑏2, ...,𝑏|𝐵|} as input. In 𝐵,
each element 𝑏𝑖∈{−1, 1}. The watermarks are inserted into 𝑀’s
weights W. The activation of corresponding full-precision LLM in
each weight channel is A𝑓.
Parameters Scoring. As mentioned in Section 3, the water-
marked LLM shall: (i) preserve original models’ quality; and (ii) be
robust against removal and forging attacks. We search for quan-
tized weight parameters with such qualities by Equation 2, where
S𝑞evaluates the quality preservation and S𝑟assesses the robustness.
The two scores are weighted using coefficients 𝛼and 𝛽(𝛼, 𝛽> 0).
S = 𝛼S𝑞+ 𝛽S𝑟
(2)
For 𝑖-th quantized weight parameter W𝑖, we measure its corre-
sponding S𝑞and S𝑟to accommodate signature 𝑏𝑗as follows. The
first quality score S𝑞is defined in Equation 3. Weight parameters
with larger absolute values are less sensitive to slight changes (addi-
tions/deletions) from watermark insertion. Thus, it results in better
quality preservation. Note that W𝑖in the minimum and maximum
quantization level is set to 0 before scoring.A smaller S𝑞indicates
the weight is less sensitive to signature insertions.
S𝑞= | 𝑏𝑗
W𝑖
|
(3)
The score S𝑟in Equation 4 measures the robustness of each
quantized weight parameter. It defends against (i) removal attacks
by watermarking on the salient region. To remove watermarks,
the adversary has to perturb a larger fraction of saliency weights,
resulting in LLM performance degradations. (ii) forging attacks by
scoring with full-precision model. Adversary does not have access
to the full-precision model, and cannot reproduce the score S𝑟for
signature counterfeiting.
The weight parameter saliency has strong correlations with
the activation magnitudes. The larger activations process more
incoming features, and the corresponding weight channels are
more sailent [12]. Inspired by this, we formulate the saliency of the
weight parameter in each channel as the normalization of current
channel magnitude |A𝑓𝑖|. A smaller S𝑟indicates the weight channel
contributes more to the LLM quality.
S𝑟= |
max (A𝑓)
A𝑓𝑖−min (A𝑓) |
(4)
EmMark scores each quantized weight parameter using Equa-
tion 2, and obtain the scores for each W. For the i-th weight param-
eter W𝑖, a smaller score means the position is better for watermark
insertion. Therefore, for a 𝑛quantization layer model, we choose
𝐵𝑐smallest candidate weight parameters from W in every quan-
tization layer as the candidate location for watermark insertion.
Here, |𝐵| ≪|𝐵𝑐| × 𝑛.

The best metric values are in bold, and the text in grey means failed watermark insertion (0% WER). ¯Δ is the average performance

Signature Insertion. To ensure the even signatures distribution,
for a 𝑛quantization layer model, we insert |𝐵|
𝑛
signatures into
each layer. To maintain the secrecy of inserted signatures, EmMark
randomly choose |𝐵|
𝑛weight parameters out of the |𝐵𝑐| candidates
in the current layer using random seed 𝑑. EmMark obtains the
watermark weight locations 𝐿. The insertion of watermarks follows
Equation 5, where the signatures are encoded into the quantized
weights. The watermark consists of (i) signature sequence 𝐵; (ii)
the random seed 𝑑, the original quantized weight W, full-precision
activation A𝑓, and 𝛼, 𝛽coefficients for location 𝐿reproduction.
W′[𝐿𝑖] = W[𝐿𝑖] + 𝑏𝑖

4.2
Watermark Extraction
Ownership Proof. EmMark reproduces the watermark weight
locations 𝐿with the random seed 𝑑, quantized model weights W,
full-precision activation A𝑓, and 𝛼, 𝛽coefficients. At 𝐿, EmMark
compares the extracted weight W′[𝐿] with the original weight
W[𝐿] and gets their difference ΔW[𝐿] using Equation 6. Model
owners can assert ownership by comparing ΔW[𝐿] with inserted
signature sequence 𝐵.
ΔW[𝐿] = W′[𝐿] −W[𝐿]
(6)
The watermark extraction rates are computed using Equation 7,
where |𝐵| is the length of the inserted signature, and |𝐵|′ is the
number of matching signature bits.

each bit has an equal probability of 0.5 to be 1 or -1.

EXPERIMENTS
5.1
Experiment Setup
Target Model We use LLaMA-2 [21] and OPT [27] family mod-
els with parameter sizes ranging from 125 million to 70 billion
as the target LLM. The models are compressed and quantized by
Smoothquant [24] to INT8 for OPT family, by LLM.int8() [5] to
INT8 for LLaMA-2 family, and by AWQ [12] to INT4. Note that Em-
Mark is agnostic to quantization algorithms. We use the the frame-
works as a proof-of-concept showing EmMark’s performance. We
watermark on top of the official model quantization instances [23].
Watermark Parameters For the target model, we insert 300-bit
signatures per INT8 quantized layer and 40-bit per INT4 quantized
layer. It yields a minimum watermarking strength of 9.09 ×10−13
for each layer, and 9.09 ×10−13𝑛for 𝑛quantized layer LLM follow-
ing Equation 8. Such watermarking strength provides sufficient
protection to the target models. The coefficients 𝛼and 𝛽are set to
0.5 and 0.5. The seed for signature insertion is 100. For model size
smaller than 6.7 billion, |𝐵𝑐|×𝑛
|𝐵|
= 50. For larger LLMs, |𝐵𝑐|×𝑛
|𝐵|
= 60.
Baselines We compare EmMark with RandomWM where water-
marks are inserted in random indexes and SpecMark where water-
marks are inserted into the high-frequency region transformed by
DCT. SpecMark is designed for full precision models, and we apply
the transformation to the quantized weights.
Evaluation Metrics The watermarked LLM performance is evalu-
ated using Perplexity (PPL) for text fluency on WikiText Dataset [14],
and, Zero-shot Accuracy (Zero-shot Acc) for token prediction on the
mean of LAMBADA, HellaSwag, PIQA, and WinoGrande Datasets [8];
the watermark extraction performance is evaluated using the per-
centage of signatures successfully extracted as Watermark Extrac-
tion Rate (WER); the watermark efficiency is evaluated using the
Insertion Time (Time) and required GPU Memory (Memory).

Results
EmMark’s Fidelity. Different watermarking frameworks’ per-
formance is in Table 1. The first and the second cells are the per-
plexity and zero-shot accuracy degradation for accommodating the
signatures. The third cell is the watermark extraction rates.
Comparison with RandomWM: While RandomWM performs
on par with the non-watermarked models in INT8 quantization, it
failed to preserve lower-bit quantization models quality. Its perfor-
mance drops significantly in INT4 quantization, where the degra-
dation is 2.29 and 0.23%, respectively, for perplexity and zero-shot
accuracy. As a result, the watermarked LLM has worse text fluency.

EmMark: Robust Watermarks for IP Protection of Embedded Quantized Large Language Models
Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY
In contrast, EmMark introduced no performance degradations com-
pared with non-watermarked LLMs in both INT8 and INT4 quan-
tization. By strategically scoring quantized parameters, EmMark
preserved the model quality during watermark insertion.
Comparison with SpecMark: As seen from Table 1, SpecMark
failed to watermark embedded LLM and achieved 0% WER in both
INT8 and INT4 quantization. The weight distributions in embed-
ded LLMs are sparse, and the small additions/deletions from the
DCT domain cannot change the discrete parameters in the weight
domain. As a result, SpecMark failed to watermark such LLMs. Em-
Mark, however, successfully inserted signatures into the embedded
model without introducing additional quality deterioration.
EmMark’s Efficiency. The efficiency is evaluated by the re-
quired time (Time) and GPU memory (Memory) for watermark
insertion on the OPT family models [27]. In Table 2, we report the
average time/memory for signature insertion per quantization layer.
For both INT8 and INT4 quantization, the time taken to watermark
one quantization layer is less than 0.4s. The insertion takes less
than 10 minutes for the largest OPT-30B model. All of EmMark’s
components are performed on CPUs, and no additional GPU mem-
ory is required for watermark insertion. As such, the efficient and
lightweight watermarking scheme makes EmMark scalable to LLMs
with larger parameter sizes.

Robustness
We evaluate EmMark’s robustness by performing the following
attacks: (i) parameter overwriting attacks, (ii) re-watermark attacks,
and (iii) forging attacks. We use the OPT-2.7B [27] model quantized
to INT4 by AWQ [12] as the target model.
The embedded model is already compressed and quantized. There-
fore, additional pruning attacks will result in model ability break-
down. Current fine-tuning on the quantized models uses LoRA-
based approaches [6] to add low-rank adaptors to learn new dataset
features. Such methods, however, will not change the quantized
model weight parameters, and cannot be used to remove signatures.
Parameter Overwriting Attacks. The adversary removes the
watermark by randomly adding one bit to the parameter weights
in the watermarked model. The attacked model performance (per-
plexity and zero-shot accuracy) and watermark extraction rates are
shown in Figure 2(a). The number of overwritten parameters in each
quantized layer is increased from 100 to 500 with a constant gap of
100. As seen, the attacked model performance drops as more bits
are overwritten. The threshold renders significant model quality
degradations is at 300-bit, where the PPL is over 100 and indicates
bad generated text fluency. Nevertheless, EmMark demonstrates
its robustness under such attacks and maintains over 99% WER.
Re-watermark Attacks. The adversary knows EmMark’s gen-
eral watermark insertion algorithm. However, he/she cannot access
the model owners’ signatures or random seeds. The adversary tries
to break the watermark by perturbing parameters potentially used
for watermarking. The watermark coefficients 𝛼and 𝛽and seed
differ from the watermark insertion stage and are set to 1, 1.5, and
22, respectively. The activation for scoring S𝑟is obtained from the
quantized LLM instead of the full-precision one. The quantization
model performance (perplexity and zero-shot accuracy) and wa-
termark extraction rates are shown in Figure 2(b). The number of
perturbed parameters in each quantized layer is increased from 100
to 300 with a constant gap of 50.
Figure 2(b) shows EmMark maintains its high watermark ex-
traction rates under re-watermark attacks. The threshold for bad
LLM quality is at 300 bits, where the zero-shot accuracy is below
20% and yields bad token prediction performance. However, the
watermarked model still maintains over 95% watermark extraction
rates, providing sufficient IP protection to the embedded LLM.

(b) Re-watermark Attacks

ing and re-watermarking attacks. The left subplot evaluates

curacy and Watermark Extraction Rate (WER).
Forging Attacks. The adversary does not remove the LLM own-
ers’ watermark. Instead, he/she claims the model ownership by
faking another set of watermarks. It is achieved by (i) counterfeiting
the watermark weight locations 𝐿𝑎with a fake signature sequence;
(ii) re-watermarking on top of the watermarked embedded LLM
by a counterfeited full-precision model activations and insertion
hyperparameters. EmMark is resilient to the two settings with a
confidential full-precision model’s activation that the adversary
does not have access to.
In the first setting, the watermark weight locations are a re-
production of the full-precision model’s activations and a set of
hyperparameters (random seed and scoring coefficients). Coun-
terfeiting the location 𝐿𝑎without such reproduction validation
process leads to failed forging attacks. In the second setting, while
the adversary proves ownership of the re-watermarked model, the
inserted signatures from owners are still highly extractable as seen
from the Re-watermark Attacks section. Notably, matching the
owners’ signatures by coincidence is nearly impossible and the

probability goes as low as 9.09 ×10−13𝑛for 𝑛quantization layer
LLM following Equation 8. Here, 𝑛=192 for OPT-2.7B, and larger
as the model size grows. As such, the owners are able to claim
ownership under forging attacks and protect the IP.

Ablation Study and Analysis
We provide further ablation study and analysis of EmMark’s capa-
bilities. The OPT-2.7B [27] quantized by AWQ [12] to INT4 is the
target model.
Effectiveness of Watermark Coefficients. We analyze how dif-
ferent 𝛼and 𝛽choices affect EmMark’s watermarking performance
in Table 3. 𝛼is changed from 0 to 1, and 𝛽is changed from 1 to 0.
The maximum watermark signature length is set to 100. As shown,
as the coefficient 𝛽becomes larger, EmMark tends to choose bits
in the saliency channel over bits with larger values. While such
insertion ensures strong IP protection, the watermarked LLM’s
quality is compromised.

Watermark Capacities. We show the maximum signature length
can be inserted into the embedded LLM without compromising its
quality in Figure 3. We increase the inserted length per quantization
layer from 50 to 200 with a constant gap of 50. As seen, the thresh-
old for maintaining watermarked LLM performance is at 100 bit. It
corresponds to a watermark strength of 1.57×10−30 per layer and
1.57×10−5760 for OPT-2.7B model following Equation 8, providing
sufficient protection to the model IP.

Watermark Integrity. To ensure integrity, EmMark shall only
prove ownership of watermarked models and generate low WER
on non-watermarked ones. In Table 4, the first model is the non-
watermarked OPT-2.7B quantized by AWQ [12], the second model
is fine-tuned on a 4k subset of the Alpaca dataset [20] before
AWQ [12] quantization, the third model is fine-tuned on Wiki-
Text dataset [14] before AWQ [12] quantization, and the fourth
model is non-watermarked OPT-2.7B quantized by GPTQ [7]. The
EmMark successfully extracts all signatures from the watermarked
model and fails to prove ownership of non-watermarked ones. As
a result, EmMark demonstrates its integrity.

CONCLUSION
We present EmMark, a novel watermarking framework for embed-
ded large language models. It inserts signatures into the compressed
and quantized models while demonstrating quality preservation
and robustness. As such, it tackles the security challenges arising
from deploying large language models in edge devices and protects
the IP of model owners. Extensive evaluations on OPT and LLaMA-
2 family models show EmMark successfully inserts 100% signatures
into the LLM with no performance compromises.
