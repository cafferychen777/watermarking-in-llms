Abstract
Embedding as a Service (EaaS) has become
a widely adopted solution, which offers fea-
ture extraction capabilities for addressing var-
ious downstream tasks in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Prior studies have shown
that EaaS can be prone to model extraction
attacks; nevertheless, this concern could be mit-
igated by adding backdoor watermarks to the
text embeddings and subsequently verifying the
attack models post-publication. Through the
analysis of the recent watermarking strategy
for EaaS, EmbMarker, we design a novel CSE
(Clustering, Selection, Elimination) attack that
removes the backdoor watermark while main-
taining the high utility of embeddings, indicat-
ing that the previous watermarking approach
can be breached. In response to this new threat,
we propose a new protocol to make the removal
of watermarks more challenging by incorpo-
rating multiple possible watermark directions.
Our defense approach, WARDEN, notably in-
creases the stealthiness of watermarks and has
been empirically shown to be effective against
CSE attack.1

Introduction
Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs), due
to their vast capacity, have showcased exceptional
proficiency in comprehending and generating nat-
ural language and proven effective in many real-
world applications (Brown et al., 2020; Radford
et al., 2019). Using them as EaaS in a black-box
API manner has become one of the most successful
commercialization paradigms. Consequently, the
owners of these models, such as OpenAI, Google,
and Mistral AI, have initiated the provision of EaaS
to aid users in various NLP tasks. For instance, one
notable provider, OpenAI (2024), with over 150

million users, recently released more performant,
cheaper EaaS models.2
Given the recent success of EaaS, the associated
vulnerabilities have started to attract attention in
security and NLP communities (Xu and He, 2023).
As a primary example, model extraction attack,
a.k.a. imitation attack, has been proven to be ef-
fective in stealing the capability of LLMs (Krishna
et al., 2020; Tramèr et al., 2016; He et al., 2021a).
To conduct such attacks, the attackers query the vic-
tim model and then train their own model based on
the collected data. Attackers usually invest far less
cost and resources than victim to provide competi-
tive services, as shown in Figure 1.a. Therefore, it
is imperative to defend against them, and the most
popular tactic is to implant statistical signals (or
watermarks) via backdoor techniques.
Beyond intellectual property (IP) infringement,
further vulnerabilities have been exposed, such as
privacy breaches (He et al., 2022a), more perfor-
mant surrogate models (Xu et al., 2022), and trans-
ferable adversarial attacks (He et al., 2021b). As
a result, backdoor watermarks are added to EaaS
embeddings enabling post-attack lawsuits because
the attack models inherit the stealthy watermarks,
which could be utilized by EaaS providers to iden-
tify them. The first work of this kind uses a pre-
determined embedding (vector) as the watermark,
which is then incorporated into text embeddings in
proportion to trigger words (Peng et al., 2023), as
illustrated in Figure 1.b. The primary requirements
for watermarking methods include: (i) they should
not lower the quality of the original application,
and (ii) it should be difficult for malicious users
to identify or deduce the secret watermark vector
(Juuti et al., 2019).
Our first work, CSE attack, challenges the afore-
mentioned second point. It involves creating a

framework CSE (Clustering, Selection, Elimina-
tion) that selects the suspected embeddings with
watermarks by comparing the distortion between
embedding pairs of the victim model and a bench-
mark model, then neutralizes the impact of the wa-
termark on the embeddings, as shown in Figure 1.c.
Empirical evidence demonstrates that CSE success-
fully compromises the watermark while preserving
high embedding utility. To mitigate the effects
of CSE, our second work introduces WARDEN,
a multi-directional Watermark Augmentation for
Robust DEfeNse mechanism, which uses multi-
ple watermark embeddings to reduce the chance of
attackers breaching all of them, as depicted in Fig-
ure 1.d. We notice that WARDEN, even with a lim-
ited number of watermarks, is successful in coun-
tering CSE. Moreover, we design a corresponding
verification protocol to allow every watermark the
authority to verify copyright violations.
Our main contributions are as follows:
• We propose CSE (Clustering, Selection, Elim-
ination) framework that breaches the recent
state-of-the-art watermarking technique for
EaaS, and we conduct extensive experiments
to evaluate its effectiveness.
• We design WARDEN to enhance the back-
door watermarks by considering various wa-
termark vectors and conditions. Our studies
suggest that the proposed defense method is
more robust against CSE and stealthier than
EmbMarker on various datasets.

Imitation Attacks
Imitation attacks (Krishna et al., 2020; Orekondy
et al., 2019; Yue et al., 2021; Wallace et al., 2020)
duplicate cloud models without access to its inter-
nal parameters, architecture, or training data. The
attack involves sending queries to the victim model
and training a functionally similar surrogate model
based on API’s responses (Chandrasekaran et al.,
2020; Tramèr et al., 2016). Liu et al. 2022, showed
that publicly deployed cloud EaaS APIs are also
vulnerable to these attacks. It poses a potential
threat to EaaS providers, as attackers can easily
extract the deployed model in reduced time and
with marginal financial investment. More concern-
ingly, such models can outperform victim models
(Xu et al., 2022) when involving victim model en-
semble and domain adaptation. Subsequently, they
may release a similar API at a lower cost, thereby
violating IP rights and causing harm to the market.

Backdoor Attacks and Watermarks
Backdoor attacks (Dai et al., 2019), a significant
subcategory of adversarial attacks (Alzantot et al.,
2018; Ebrahimi et al., 2018), involves inserting
textual triggers into a target model such that the
victim model behaves normally until the backdoor
is activated. Recent works (Zhang et al., 2023;
Chen et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2023) have shown
that pre-trained LLMs are susceptible to backdoor
attacks and transferable to downstream tasks.
Recent research (Li et al., 2022; Tang et al.,
2023; Peng et al., 2023) has utilized backdoor as
the essential technology to integrate verifiable wa-
termark information in deep learning models, espe-
cially LLMs (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023). The rea-
son is that other techniques, such as altering model
parameters (Uchida et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2022),
need white-box access and are non-transferable in
model extraction attacks. Similarly, lexical wa-
termarks (He et al., 2022b,c) do not work on em-
beddings in the EaaS use case. Drawing inspi-
ration from backdoor attacks, one can correspond
EaaS embeddings to a pre-defined watermark when
trigger conditions are satisfied. One such work,
EmbMarker (Peng et al., 2023), uses just a single
embedding and adds this to original embeddings
linearly as per the number of moderate-frequency
trigger words. However, it was verified against a
narrow set of similarity invariant attacks, leaving
scope for superior attacks and countermeasures.

Methodology
In this section, we first present an overview of the
conventional backdoor watermark framework to
counter model extraction attacks, then proceed to
a detailed design of our CSE attack. Next, we
explain WARDEN, the multi-directional watermark
extension to the previous watermarking technique.
3.1
Preliminary
Malicious attackers target the EaaS victim service
Sv, based on victim model Θv, by sending texts t
as queries to receive corresponding original embed-
dings eo. Considering the threat of model extrac-
tion attacks, the victim backdoors original embed-
ding eo using a watermarking function f to inject
an additional pre-defined embedding t to return
provided embedding ep = f(eo, t). Then, the at-
tack model Θa is trained on ep which is received
by querying Θv, and the attacker provides a com-
petitive service Sa based on model Θa. Copyright
protection is feasible when f adheres to these crite-
ria: (i) the original EaaS provider should be able to
query Sa to verify if Θa has imitated Θv; (ii) the
utility of provided embeddings ep is comparable to
eo for downstream tasks.
3.2
CSE Attack Framework
This section outlines our Clustering, Selection, and
Elimination (CSE) attack, as the framework shown
in Figure 2. This approach aims at (i) identifying
3

the embedding vectors most likely to contain the
watermark and (ii) eliminating the influence of the
watermark while preserving the essential semantics
within the embeddings.
Clustering
We first employ clustering algorithms
to organize the embeddings in the dataset (which
attackers have retrieved) into groups. This action
enhances the subsequent selection step by: (i) im-
proving the efficiency of calculating pair-wise dis-
tance within smaller sets of embeddings, and (ii)
providing distinct groups of poisoned data entries,
which facilitates the identification of more anoma-
lous pairs. K-Means algorithm (Arthur et al., 2007)
is used as the primary clustering approach, while
we discuss the effectiveness of other clustering
methods in Appendix C.1. Nevertheless, clustering
solely is not sufficient for filtering out the water-
marked embeddings. For instance, we can observe
from the contour lines in Figure 3 that watermarked
samples are spread across clusters and inconspicu-
ous. Furthermore, the centroids of the watermarked
samples and overall clusters do not coincide. To
counteract this, we thus propose the selection mod-
ule to identify the most suspicious embeddings
with the watermark.

pendix C.2 for plots of other datasets.
Selection
We denote the victim model as Θv
and introduce another hold-out standard model (or
benchmark model) as Θs. Within each cluster Ci,
we conduct pairwise evaluations on the correspond-
ing embeddings ep (provided embedding) and es
(standard embedding). Those with distinctive dis-
tance changes are considered suspected samples.

Figure 4: Similarity distribution plot between the target
embedding and various embedding types. As we can
see, the suspected embeddings returned by the selection
module in CSE are distinctly different from unsuspected
embeddings and more akin to the target embedding. The
results for other datasets are reported in Appendix B.
EmbMarker incorporates varying proportions of
a predetermined target embedding into texts con-
taining trigger words. Since the predefined tar-
get embedding lacks shared semantic meaning, we
hypothesize that the distance between embedding
pairs, which have notable contributions from water-
marks, exhibit anomaly behavior (validated in Fig-
ure 4) compared to corresponding distances derived
from a standard language model, such as BERT
(Devlin et al., 2019). Such difference is used to
reflect the significance of the abnormal rank of wa-
termarked pairs, as estimated by
Dp = Rank(Dv) −Rank(Ds),
(1)
where Dv and Ds are cosine similarity disparities
between victim embeddings (i.e., ep1 and ep2) po-
tentially containing watermark, and the standard
embeddings 3 (i.e., es1 and es2) probably without
watermarks. The Rank function indicates the rank
of the similarity scores by the embedding pairs in
the set of scores (Dv or Ds). The distinction be-
tween the suspected and unsuspected embeddings
is illustrated in Figure 4.
Elimination
Given the suspicious embeddings
that are potentially watermarked from the previ-
ous step, we hypothesize that the watermark can
be identified and recovered in suspicious embed-
dings’ top principal components (validated in Sec-
tion 4.2) because the target embedding would be
common among them. Following this idea, we pro-
pose an elimination algorithm, composed of two

steps. First, we apply singular value decomposition
(SVD) (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) to analyze and
identify the top K principal components. Then,
the contribution of these components are iteratively
eliminated using the Gram-Schmidt (GS) process
(Trefethen and Bau, 1997). The elimination step for
each principal component vector is demonstrated
as follows:
u⟨k+1⟩= e⟨k⟩−Proj(e⟨k⟩, c⟨k⟩).
(2)
In the projection function (Perwass et al., 2009),
e⟨k⟩is projected onto the k-th principal component
c⟨k⟩, denoted as
Proj(e⟨k⟩, c⟨k⟩) = c⟨k⟩· e⟨k⟩
||c⟨k⟩||
· c⟨k⟩.
(3)
Here, e⟨0⟩is initialized with ep. After each iter-
ation, e⟨k+1⟩is acquired by normalizing u⟨k+1⟩
such that Norm
 u⟨k+1⟩
= u⟨k+1⟩/||u⟨k+1⟩||.
3.3
WARDEN Defense Framework
In response to the successful CSE attack, we
propose Watermark Augmentation for Robust
DEfeNse (WARDEN) as a counter measurement,
which incorporates multiple directions as water-
marking embeddings.
Multi-Directional Watermarks
To diversify the
possibility of watermark directions (or target em-
beddings), we introduce multiple watermarks,
noted as W = {w1, w2, ..., wR}. This strategy
increases the difficulty of inferring all of them via
the elimination module in CSE attack. These wa-
termarks remain confidential on servers and can
be subject to regular updates. We randomly split
the trigger words set, T into R independent subsets
Tr for R watermarks. Then the trigger counting
function, λr is the frequency of trigger words in
Tr set with a maximum threshold of m (level of
watermark). Finally, we add watermarks to the
original embedding eo for text S to generate the
corresponding embedding ep as follows:
Norm
 
(1 −
R
X
r=1
λr(S)) · eo +
R
X
r=1
λr(S) · wr
!
.
(4)
One thing to note is that because we split T for mul-
tiple watermarks, the proportion of watermarked
samples is independent of R and is the same as
in the single watermark case. Due to weight val-
ues being implicitly normalised λ(S) = λ1(S) +
λ2(S) + . . . + λR(S), where λ(S) is watermark
weight used on a single trigger set.
Multi-Watermark Verification
We adopt a con-
servative approach to copyright verification with
multiple watermarks, i.e., if any watermark confi-
dently flags IP infringement, we consider it positive.
Hence, we build verification datasets, backdoor
texts Dbr and benign text Dn as follows:
Dbr = {[t1, t2, ..., tm]|ti ∈Tr}, ∀r ∈[1..R],
Dn = {[t1, t2, ..., tm]|ti /∈T}.
(5)
The premise is that embeddings for these back-
door texts will be closer to their corresponding
target embedding in contrast to benign texts in the
case of watermarks. We leverage this behavior
of embedding backdoors to verify copyright in-
fringement at each watermark level. We quantify
the closeness by computing cosine similarity and
squared L2 distance between target embeddings
W and embeddings of Dbr and Dn, i.e.,
cosir =
ei · wr
||ei|| · ||wr||,
l2ir =


ei
||ei|| −
wr
||wr||


2
,
Cbr = {cosir |i ∈Dbr}, Cnr = {cosir |i ∈Dn},
Lbr = {l2ir|i ∈Dbr}, Lnr = {l2ir|i ∈Dn},
(6)
where r ∈[1..R].
The copyright detection performance is evalu-
ated by taking the difference of averaged cosine
similarity and averaged squared L2 distance as per
Equation 7. Furthermore, we compute the p-valuej
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test (Berger
and Zhou, 2014) as the third metric, which com-
pares these test value distributions. We aim to reject
the null hypothesis: The two cosine similarity value
sets Cbr and Cnr are consistent.

(7)
We evaluate these three metrics independently
for all the watermarks and then combine them,
∆cos = max
1≤r≤R ∆cosr,
∆l2 = min
1≤r≤R ∆l2r,
p-value = min
1≤r≤R p-valuer.

The core idea is that overall infringement can be
certified by the infringement of any one of the tar-
get watermarking embeddings.

Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate different aspects
of our techniques, we adopt the following metrics:
• (Downstream) Task Performance We con-
struct a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classi-
fier with the EaaS embeddings as inputs. The
quality of the embeddings is measured by the
accuracy and F1-score of the classifiers on the
downstream tasks.
• (Reconstruction) Attack Performance We
measure the closeness of reconstructed target
embedding(s) (more details in Section 4.2)
with original target embedding(s) by reporting
their cosine similarity.
• (Infringement) Detection Performance Fol-
lowing previous work (Peng et al., 2023), we
employ three metrics, i.e., p-value, difference
of cosine similarity, and difference of squared
L2 distance. Their customized variations for
WARDEN are defined in Section 3.3. Our find-
ings largely rely on this evaluation as it reflects
the performance in real-world applications.

Table 2: Copyright verification can be bypassed when
the target direction is known and eliminated from the
provided embeddings.
Hence, we evaluate whether we are able to bypass
the copyright verification using the same water-
mark detection metrics with an opposite objective,
i.e., lower p-value and the absolute values of ∆
metrics close to zero.
Watermark Elimination
One of the critical el-
ements in the EmbMarker is the secret target em-
bedding (w) used for adding the watermark. The
objective of CSE is to recover and erase this direc-
tion from the provided embeddings to circumvent
copyright verification. We show later (see Table 3)
that such elimination is feasible and does not dete-
riorate the EaaS quality. To demonstrate that, we
start with a simplified case where we assume ac-
cess to this target embedding and directly remove
this direction. Expectedly, as seen in Table 2, we
can bypass the copyright verification with mini-
mal impact on the downstream utility performance.
Moreover, this validates the importance of the pro-
jection technique employed in CSE. Additionally,
this raises another technique’s vulnerability of en-
suring target embedding is kept secure.
Watermark Reconstruction
In a successful at-
tack, the principal components c⟨k⟩removed from
the embeddings erase the watermark by recovering
the target embedding. To validate this conjecture,
we model and solve an optimization problem as
defined in Equation 9 where a linear combination
of c⟨k⟩results in the recovered target embedding
w. We then calculate cosine similarity to the target
embedding w. A high cosine similarity demon-
strates the CSE technique’s effectiveness. For CSE,
the reconstructed target embedding is extremely
(99+% cosine similarity) close to the original target
embedding (more in following Section 4.2),

Effectiveness Evaluation
In Table 3, CSE along
with model extraction attack is proved effective in
removing the influence from EmbMarker. Detec-
tion performance dropped to almost the original
case, which indicates the EaaS provider will not be
able to detect the imitation attack performed by the
attacker. In addition, for SST2, MIND, AG News
datasets, the downstream performance dropped 1-
2%, which demonstrates the attack preserves the
embeddings utility. We skip attack performance in
the Table 3 as they all have (almost) full watermark
reconstruction. However, we discuss this in Sec-
tion 4.3 where we observe varying values due to
the ineffectiveness of CSE attack against WARDEN
defense.
Ablation Study
An attacker will not be aware
whether the model they are trying to imitate is wa-
termarked. Table 4 shows that our attack leads to
only minor quality degradation for such scenarios,
demonstrating the suitability of CSE. We perform
further extensive quantitative and qualitative sensi-
tivity study to investigate how other factors (such as
algorithms, parameters, and models) affect the effi-
cacy of our suggested CSE attack in Appendix C.

utility. The results on other datasets also show sim-
ilar patterns which can be found in Appendix D.1.
WARDEN against CSE
Now, we investigate the
effectiveness of WARDEN against CSE (shown in
Figure 6). As observed in the previous section,
WARDEN is stealthier with increasing watermarks.
As expected, the performance of CSE diminishes,
correlating with decreasing attack performance (red
line). Due to the usage of more watermarks, there
is a natural increase in the likelihood that one of
them will detect an infringement. Moreover, in
extreme scenarios, a mixture of multiple target em-
beddings will substitute the watermarked samples
(Equation 4), reducing the impact of the CSE at-
tack’s exploitation of the semantic distortion in the
embeddings.
Gram-Schmidt Extension
To further strengthen
WARDEN, we investigate the application of the
Gram-Schmidt (GS) process (Trefethen and Bau,
1997) on target embeddings W , as we assume the
orthogonal set of watermark embeddings are more
distinguishable to each other. In our experiments,
as reported in Figure 7, the detection performance
is stronger after GS selection. In addition, due to
orthogonality, the reconstructed target embedding
cosine similarities will be significantly lower, indi-
cating CSE might also be ineffective. We observe
the same from the corresponding ablation study in
Appendix D.1.

Ablation Study
Similar to the experiments for
CSE, we perform WARDEN on non-watermarked
models. Due to our strict verification, for the high
value of R, the p-value could be noisy. It is be-
cause the verification process might find closeness
due to genuine semantics instead of backdoors as a
result of a high pool of watermark directions. This
could lead to false positives, i.e., incorrectly clas-
sifying models as copied. However, in such cases,
we observe that other detection metrics (∆based)
metrics are reliable, which should aid the entity
in making appropriate decisions (refer Figure 18).
We conduct a further detailed ablation study dis-
secting the WARDEN components and showing its
stealthiness in Appendix D.

Conclusion
In this paper, we first demonstrate that our new CSE
attack can bypass the recent EaaS watermarking
technique. CSE cleanses the watermarked dataset
by clustering them first, then selecting embedding
pairs with disparity, and finally eliminating their
top principal components, while maintaining the
service utility. To remedy this shortcoming, we pro-
pose a simple yet effective watermarking method,
WARDEN, which augments the previous approach
by introducing multiple watermarks to embeddings.
Our intensive experiments show that WARDEN is
superior in verifying the copyright of EaaS from
prior works. Furthermore, WARDEN is also effec-
tive against potent CSE, which shows its resilience
to different attacks. We also conduct detailed ab-
8

lation studies to verify the importance of every
component of CSE and WARDEN. Future studies
may consider exploring watermark ownership un-
der multi-owner service settings.
Limitations
We test our WARDEN defense against CSE attack,
acknowledging that various other attacks might
overcome the uni-directional watermark approach.
Although publishing the WARDEN algorithm to
the public may inspire future attacks against it, we
do not foresee it to be a trivial task, as the capabil-
ity of WARDEN can be enhanced by using more
conservative strategies, e.g., more stealthy trigger
patterns and watermarking techniques.
We also know that by having access to the
ground-truth watermarking vectors, combined with
the GS process, one can eliminate the WARDEN
watermarks, as discussed in Appendix D.3. How-
ever, it is the service provider’s responsibility to
maintain the confidentiality of their watermarking
keys.
We also note the false positive of the p-value for
non-watermarked models when a large number of
watermark vectors are augmented (Figure 18), even
though other metrics rectify this incorrect signal.
We suggest service providers conduct a prelimi-
nary study to select the number of watermarks for
WARDEN. In this regard, the current work is an em-
pirical observation study, and theoretical analysis
might help decide the optimal number of water-
marks. In future, we will endeavour to investigate
advanced watermarking mechanisms focusing on
defence purposes.
Social Impact
We developed a CSE attack, which could aid at-
tackers in circumventing EaaS IP infringements.
We agree that with CSE, any existing system using
EmbMarker is vulnerable. Yet, we argue that it is
critical to show the possibility of such attacks and
make users aware of them. The usual first step in
security is to first expose the vulnerability. Addi-
tionally, to mitigate the aforementioned threat, we
contribute an improved watermarking technique,
WARDEN, which could be incorporated with mini-
mal effort.

Appendix
A
Experimental Settings
We leverage the standard codebase of the Trans-
formers (Wolf et al., 2020) library and AdamW
(Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) algorithm for model
training and development. Likewise, we use scikit-
learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) for clustering algo-
rithms and other utility calculations. We use GPT-3
text-embedding-002 API as original benign embed-
dings and the BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) model as
the victim model. We perform all the experiments
on a single A100 GPU with CUDA 11.7 and py-
torch 2.1.2. We assume that both the victim model
and imitators use the same datasets to separate the
effects of the watermarking technique from other
factors. Furthermore, we assume that the extracted
model is trained only using the watermarked out-
puts from the victim model. Finally, we implement
the EmbMarker and other experiments following
their default configurations and settings, i.e., m =
4, n = 20, and frequency interval = [0.5%, 1%].
The only exception is the R = 10 case in WAR-
DEN, where we use n = 50 to have enough trigger
words. A standard dataset, WikiText (Merity et al.,
2016) consisting of 1, 801, 350 entries, serves as a
hold-out dataset for selecting moderate-frequency
words as watermark triggers (T).
B
Similarity Distribution Plots
The observations (captured in Figure 8) for other
datasets are similar to SST2 as seen in Figure 4,
i.e., watermarked embeddings are closer to target
embedding, and there is a clear difference in simi-
larities for watermarked and non-watermarked em-
beddings. Due to skewness between the number of
suspected and unsuspected embeddings, we employ
sampling for unsuspected entries in these plots.
C
CSE Attack Analyses
In this section, we perform detailed ablation studies
for CSE attack.
C.1
Comparison of Clustering Algorithms
The previous experiments utilize K-Means as the
clustering algorithm. However, alternative algo-
rithms such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
(Reynolds et al., 2009) are also valid options. The
subsequent table, Table 5, illustrates the compar-
ative performance between K-Means and GMM.
While K-Means exhibits superior performance

in downstream utility for AG News, Enron, and
MIND datasets, it is less confident for delta val-
ues in the case of Enron and MIND. Overall both
algorithms demonstrate satisfactory performance,
suggesting that the clustering module for CSE is
universally adaptable to different clustering algo-
rithms.
C.2
Number of Clusters (n)
We can see from Figure 9 that there is no significant
role in the number of clusters (n). In all the cases,
CSE attack is successful, though we use n = 20 in
our experiments. However, considering pairwise
distance comparison, it is preferable to have fewer
clusters to increase the likelihood of watermarked
pairs. We also visualize these clusters in Figure 10.
C.3
Number of Principal Components (K)
In Section 4.2, we formulated an optimization prob-
lem to compute how much of the watermark we are
recovering for a given number of principal compo-
nents (ck). As expected, with increasing K, we will
recover more of the target embeddings, as noted
from the red line in Figure 11. However, the utility
metrics deteriorate more significantly (blue line).
Meanwhile, a lower K does not recover enough
target embedding to bypass copyright verification
(yellow and green lines – detection performance).
To achieve the best of both worlds—downstream
utility and avoiding watermark—we must strike
a balance, and 50 components seem appropriate.
Further, in some cases, we observe that the increas-
ing K does not affect the downstream utility met-
rics. The downstream task’s simplicity could be the
cause of this. For example, Enron dataset is a bi-
nary classification task wherein required data could
be represented in a few embedding dimensions.

Table 6: The impact of extracted model size on CSE
performance.
C.4
Impact of Attacker Model Size
We evaluate if there are any differences in our at-
tack’s performance for different attacker model
sizes. This is tested by performing experiments
on small, base, and large versions of the BERT
(Devlin et al., 2019) model. As illustrated in the
Table 6, the attack effectively bypasses the water-
mark when the stealer uses different sizes of the
backbone model.

WARDEN Defense Analyses
D.1
Remaining Dataset Results
In this subsection, we present the results (Figure 12-
15) for all the remaining datasets discussed in Sec-
tion 4.3.
D.2
Number of Principal Components (K) in
CSE
Because we augment more target embeddings in
WARDEN, default configurations of CSE may not
be adequate. We tweak the CSE attack by increas-
ing the principal components eliminated, as shown
in Figure 16. We note that for a higher number of
principal components, CSE is effective in some se-
tups, as we recover more of the target embeddings.
However, one thing to note is that the downstream
metrics are poor if we eliminate a large number of
principal components, undermining the attacker’s
objective.
D.3
Access to Target Embeddings
In the unlikely event that an attacker has access to
all the target embeddings, it should be possible to
bypass WARDEN. We replicate this scenario and
apply the elimination step of the CSE attack using
these embeddings. As expected, in such a case, we
can circumvent WARDEN (see Figure 17).

Figure 10: t-SNE (Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) visualisations for K-Means clustering (n = 3) for different
datasets. It is evident from the plots that the watermarked samples are not clustered together but instead spread
across the embedding space with non-coinciding centroids.
